                                certification course, the magnitude of the difference between the projected total
                                numbers of new job seekers and job openings over the whole projection period (2019-2028)
                                is analyzed in conjunction with an assessment of labour market conditions in recent
                                years. Over the 2016-2018 period, employment in this occupational group increased at a
                                pace that was substantially higher than the average of all occupations. The unemployment
                                rate was stable, and remained close to its historical trend and significantly below the
                                national average in 2018. Finally, the number of unemployed workers per job vacancy
                                remained stable and close to the national average over the period. Hence, the analysis
                                of key labour market indicators, specially the lack of available unemployed workers,
                                suggests that the number of job openings exceeded substantially the number of job
                                seekers in this occupational group over the 2016-2018 period.</p>

                        <br>
                        <li>
                            <p>As job openings and job seekers are projected to be relatively similar over the 2019-2028 period, the labour shortage conditions seen in recent years are expected to continue over the projection period. Retirements and job growth are expected to account for the majority of job openings. Employment growth is projected to be one of the strongest among all occupations. As a result, job creation will represent about half of all openings, a proportion that is above the average of all occupations (about 27% of openings). Most of these workers are employed in service industries such as computer systems design and related services; finance, insurance, real estate and leasing services; telecommunications, information and culture services; and public administration. Demand for workers in this occupation is expected to be supported by technological changes. Indeed, rapid innovation will continue, inducing Canadian firms to adapt quickly and upgrade their IT infrastructure to remain digitally safe and competitive. 
                                With regard to labour supply, school leavers are expected to be the main source of labour in this occupational group, representing about three quarters of the job seekers. Immigration will continue to be a major contributor to job seekers, as this occupational group is very popular among newcomers. </p>

                            <p>In this week, you’ll spend more time thinking about where data come from. The
                                highest-quality statistical analyses of data will always incorporate information about
                                the process used to generate the data, or features of the data collection design. You’ll
                                be exposed to important concepts related to sampling from larger populations, including
                                probability and non-probability sampling, and how we can make inferences about larger
                                populations based on well-designed samples. You’ll also learn about the concept of a
                                sampling distribution, and how estimation of the variance of that distribution plays a
                                critical role in making statements about populations. Finally, you’ll learn about the
                                importance of reading the documentation for a given data set; a key step in looking at
                                data is also looking at the available documentation for that data set, which describes
                                how the data were generated.</p>
